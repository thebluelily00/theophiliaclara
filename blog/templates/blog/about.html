  <p>Theophilia Clara was created with the intent of helping people live the best life they can.
     This blog was named after my great grandmother, a woman whose name is always spoken with love and stories of kindness.
     With that in mind, my goal is to provide information to begin improving your life in small ways, and spread the goodness
     to others 😊
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>My posts are centered around the following topics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Style</strong> for everyday, school, and formal</li>
    <li><strong>Food</strong> that's wholesome and delicious</li>
    <li><strong>Organization</strong> + design ideas</li>
    <li><strong>Music</strong> reccomendations based on season + mood</li>
  </ul>

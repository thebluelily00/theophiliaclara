  <p>This blog is named after my great grandmother. Her name has always been associated with care and positivity, appearing like a beam of light in others' lives. With that in mind, I'd like this blog to serve the same purpose! I want to help others become better, more fulfilled versions of themselves. </p>
   <p>My posts are centered around the following topics:</p>
  <ul style="line-height:200%;">
    <li><strong>Style</strong> for casual situations, going out, and everywhere in between!</li>
    <li><strong>Life</strong> organization, advice, routines, and other things to improve daily living</li>
    <li><strong>Entertainment</strong> whether it be a list of TV to try this weekend or a book I just finished and coulndn't put down.</li>
    <li><strong>Food</strong> ideas for breakfast and healthy desserts, with some meal prep thrown in every now and then.</li>
  </ul>

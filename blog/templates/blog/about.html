    <!--Theophilia Clara was created with the intent of helping people live the best life they can. This blog was named after my great grandmother, a woman whose name is always spoken with love and stories of kindness. With that in mind, my goal is to provide information to begin improving your life in small ways, and spread the goodness to others 😊-->

  <p>This blog is named after my great grandmother. Her name has always been associated with care and positivity, appearing like a beam of light in others' lives. With that in mind, I'd like this blog to serve the same purpose! I want to help others become better, more fulfilled versions of themselves. </p>
   <p>My posts are centered around the following topics:</p>
  <ul style="line-height:200%;">
    <li><strong>Style</strong> for whatever occasion you may encounter</li>
    <li><strong>Food</strong> that's wholesome and delicious</li>
    <li><strong>Organization</strong> & design ideas</li>
    <li><strong>Music</strong> and playlists for every mood & situation</li>
    <li>Plus, whatever else I think of!</li>
  </ul>
